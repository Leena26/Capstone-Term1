                        You can make a change. Hundreds of
                        people die every year of lack of food and clean 
                        water. No, you don't have to travel to the people 
                        in poverty and help. Stay where you are! You can
                         donate money to organizations that provide for 
                         these people. There are many organizations that
                         help lift people out of poverty.
