                <p>
                    Poverty is a state or condition in which 
                    a person or community lacks the financial 
                    resources and essentials for a minimum standard 
                    of living. Poverty means that the income level from
                    employment is so low that basic human needs 
                    can't be met. Poverty-stricken people and families
                    might go without proper housing, clean water, healthy
                    food, and medical attention. Each nation may have its own
                    threshold that determines how many of its people are living
                    in poverty.
